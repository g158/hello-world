Gretchen here. I find writing things about myself stressful. 
I am a literature professor at a mid-sized universty in the U.S. Mid-West.  
It's been a hard and strange year. 
I am trying to do things in my life that I want to do. 
I want to learn to code (maybe will use it in my teaching--or maybe not). 
I have three dogs.
